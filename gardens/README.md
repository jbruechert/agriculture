# Minetest Mod Gardens

This Minetest mod adds gardens that are generated into the world. When you dig
them, they will drop a random set of seeds that can be registered by mods like
agriculture.

If you want to take them with you and multiply them, you can rightclick the
garden and it will drop itself. To multiply them you just need to pay attention
that there are not many other plants like flower or grass in the near
environment. Then you just need to wait a while. This works exactly as with
flowers and also requires the `flowers` mod from Minetest Game to be installed
to work.

## Dependencies

The gardens mod has no dependencies, but it will only make sense to use it with
for example the `agriculture` mod for seeds and the `flowers` mod from Minetest
Game for gardens reproduction.
